/**
 * A composable OpenStreetMap View.
 *
 * It is to be noted, that this map does not store the current position and zoom when using it.
 * Note to self: Should I still add it or is that a little bit of overkill for this Android Project?

 * @param modifier Modifiers to apply to the map.
 * @param onLoad This will get called once the map has been loaded.
 * @param clipToOutline This will let the View clip to its outline and not take the whole screen.
